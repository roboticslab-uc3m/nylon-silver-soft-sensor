## Installation

To have an isolated testing, we recommend installing a virtual environment like [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). If you don't know how to install it, check [this tutorial](https://vistormu.github.io/posts/conda.html).

Once you have your virtual environment activated, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/nylon-silver-soft-sensor.git
```

and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```
